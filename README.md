# iris-flower-classification

This project implements an iris flower classification model that accurately identifies and classifies species of iris flowers based on their physiological characteristics. The model distinguishes between the three major species of irises: *Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*, and also includes a feature to determine if the flower shows any spotting.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the Iris dataset for analysis.
- **Classification Algorithms**: Random forest classification 
- **Model Evaluation**: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to evaluate model performance.
- **Visualization**: Includes plots for visual insights into the dataset and classification results.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies.
3. Run the main script to train the model and classify iris flowers.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
